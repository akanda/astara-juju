# Overview

This charm provides the astara-orchestrator component of the Astara network orchestration service for OpenStack clouds.

Astara aims to simplify networking in OpenStack clouds by removing the need for complex controllers and gateway nodes, offloading routing, loadbalancing and other advanced networking serivces onto
the cloud itself.  It does this by virtualizing network functions and orchestrating them as VNFs running on Nova.  For more information see https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Astara.

# Usage

This charm is a subordinate to the nova-compute charm.  It also requires the deploynment of the astara-neutron-api subordinate charm alongside neutron-api.  It eliminates the need for
the neutron-gateway charm as routing L3 routing is now handled by the compute tier.

The astara-orchestrator charm has two core functions:

    * Creates, initializes and manages the astara-orchestrator database.
    * Creates and configues service endpoint keystone.
    * Configures access to the message queue.
    * Configures and runs the astara-orchestrator service.

Step by step instructions on using the charm.  This assumes the keystone, neutron-api, glance services have already been deployed.

    juju deploy astara-neutron-api
    juju deploy astara-orchestrator
    juju add-relation astara-orchestrator nova-compute
    juju add-relation astara-orchestrator mysql
    juju add-relation astara-orchestrator rabbitmq-server
    juju add-relation astara-orchestrator keystone
    juju add-relation astara-orchestrator astara-neutron-api
    juju add-relation astara-neutron-api neutron-api
    juju add-relation astara-neutron-api keystone
    juju add-relation astara-neutron-api glance

After a successful deployment, the astara-orchestrator should be running on your nova-compute nodes.

If you plan to run multiple units of nova-compute, you'll end up running multiple units of the astara-orchestrator service as well.
The service is designed to scale out with the help of an external coordination service, provided via the tooz library. The preferred
coordination service is zookeeper, but memcached may be used for dev/testing.  To enable astara-orchestrator clustering, also deploy
the coordination service and add an additional relation to astara-orchestrator:

    juju deploy zookeeper
    juju add-relation zookeeper astara-orchestrator

    OR (for testing only)

    juju deploy memcached
    juju add-relatno memcached astara-orchestrator

# Configuration

The charm follows the rest of the OpenStack charm standards as far as configuring installation sources via the openstack-origin or openstack-origin-git settings. It also uses the standard options for configuring database and message queue user and resource names.
