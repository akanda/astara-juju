      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,
      or a supported Cloud Archive release pocket.

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include:

      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/updates
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/staging
      cloud:<series>-<openstack-release>/proposed

      For series=Precise we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * icehouse

      For series=Trusty we support cloud archives for openstack-release:
         * juno
         * kilo
         * ...

      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade.

      NOTE: when openstack-origin-git is specified, openstack specific
      packages will be installed from source rather than from the
      openstack-origin repository.
  openstack-origin-git:

    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies a YAML-formatted dictionary listing the git
      repositories and branches from which to install OpenStack and
      its dependencies.

      Note that the installed config files will be determined based on
      the OpenStack release of the openstack-origin option.
